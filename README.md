# Arcane Incrementalist

Arcane Incrementalist is an incremental game where you take on the role of an occult conjurer, summoning spirits and demons, learning forbidden knowledge from them, and trying not to go insane. 

Created for Ludum Dare 37, a 72-hour game jam, with the theme of "One Room".
Uses the RocketBoots web game kit, jQuery, Lodash, Mustache, Google Fonts, and a few images from Wikimedia Commons; everything else is original and Â© 2016.
Code is open source, released under the MIT license.
